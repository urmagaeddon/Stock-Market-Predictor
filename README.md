📈 StockPredictorinator

StockPredictorinator is a machine learning project that predicts the **next-day movement of the S&P 500 index** using historical stock price data.  

It uses **Yahoo Finance data**, feature engineering (rolling averages & trends), and a **RandomForestClassifier** to forecast whether the market will go **up** or **down**.  

 🚀 Features
- Pulls **historical S&P 500 data** using [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/).
- Creates features such as **moving averages** and **trend indicators**.
- Trains a **RandomForestClassifier** to predict up/down movement.
- Includes a **backtesting framework** to evaluate performance.
- Reports metrics like **precision score** to measure prediction reliability.


 ⚙️ Installation
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stockpredictorinator.git
cd stockpredictorinator
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
📊 Usage
Run the script:

python stockpredictorinator.py
Example workflow inside the script:

Download S&P 500 historical data.

Generate features (Close ratios, rolling averages, trends).

Train a RandomForestClassifier.

Backtest the model with walk-forward validation.

Print precision scores and plot predictions vs. true labels.

📈 Example Output

Precision Score: 0.57
Predictions Value Counts:
0    1420
1     980
dtype: int64
Backtest visualization:

Blue = True market direction

Orange = Model predictions
